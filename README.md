This variation of Tic-Tac-Toe utilizes command line I/O, strong object-oriented design principles, and game design principles. 
The result being a simple, but extremely reusable and modular set of classes. The game itself can be played by two people taking turns,
one person against an AI, or two AI players. Additionaly, players can attempt to play against an unbeatable AI. Robust input error 
checking is maintained throughout as well.
